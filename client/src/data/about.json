  "description": "I am a 4th year student of Architecture at the Cracow University of Technology. I constantly develop my passion for design and architecture, gaining knowledge about new trends. I also deepen my skills in creating projects using modern design software. I developed these skills during my work at the APA Zalewski Bubak architectural office in Krakow (July - September 2019). As an engineering thesis, I designed the Sport Center in Troniny, which is on the list of the above projects. My passions are drawing and painting, which I create in my free time."
